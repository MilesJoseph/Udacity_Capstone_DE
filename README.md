## Capstone Project

  This repo is for the final project in the data engineering nano degree for Udacity. This repo is the culmination of what we have learned during the course. I am choosing to complete the project with the data that is being provided by Udacity.

## Project Parameters

  This project is based on the assumption that this data would be inserted into an s3 bucket at regular intervals/real time.

## Project Goals

  I will build a data lake on s3 that can be used to query weather and demographics of popular immigration destinations. Prospective immigrants could use this to determine where they might want to live. This data could also be used by any persons or companies that might look to invest in these locations based on the variables available. I am going to limit the data to the U.S.

## Data Sources
